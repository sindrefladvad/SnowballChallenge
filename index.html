            <p> Awful soda for a better world. With revolutionary technology we can store up to 10 times as much carbon in a can.

            <h2><b>Small can, large impact</b></h2>
            <p>The ocean is the planetâ€™s largest carbon sink, absorbing around 23 per cent of annual CO2 emissions generated by human activity.
                We want to store the CO2 emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
                With revolutionary technology we can store up to 10 times as much carbon in a can. The design is simple, but the solution is complex.
                By collaborating with Coca Cola company, Carbon Capture is able to store immense amounts of CO2.
                Coca Cola provides large scale production, so our impact can reach over 200 countries with over 2 billion cans produced each year.
                Sustainable, circular and green production for a better future.
                Solving the world's largest problem with the world's largest soda producer. Sounds too good to be true and tastes too bad to be good.</p>

            <h2><b>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.</b></h2>
            <p>Our Carbon Capture cans are made of 100 percent recycled aluminum. They are also recyclable so your can will live forever in a circular life of infinite production.
            CO2 is captured from our high tech state of the art capturing facilities. We capture the excess production emition and pack it straight back in the can.
            This way our production is a null sum game. Producing one can yields 170g CO2. In one can we can store 1700g of CO2. Small can, with a large impact.
